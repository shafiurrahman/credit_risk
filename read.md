# Project Conclusion :- 
# Created a decision tree and show it to stakeholders. This will create awareness about the kind of rules that a Tree might 
# come up with
# Now speak about the benefit of ensembles and how they achieve a higher degress of robustness than a single tree
# Now is the time to show that the ensemble is as good if not better than the decison tree
# This way you can first sell the idea of a tree based solution and then sell the final product which is an ensemble of the
# idea you have already sold(decision tree)
